  <h3>When Wine Goes Bad....</h3>
  <p> Wine is great to drink with friends, to relax after a long day and to enjoy with food. But what about when its not? </br> </p>
  <p class="subtext">  Wine that has gone bad is often referred to as ‘corked’ and this means that a contaminant has entered the bottle. </br> While still safe to drink the taste would be unpleasant.
    To tell if your wine is corked use these three easy steps </br>
  </br> </p>
    <ol id="badwinelist">
      <li> Swirl the wine in your glass - sometimes if a wine has been sat for a while it needs a swirl to open up </li>
    </br>
      <li> Look at the wine - if its a white wine, is it straw or gold coloured? If a red wine - does it have a brown tinge? </li>
    </br>
      <li> Smell the wine - does it smell like wet dog, musty cellar or old newspaper? </li>
    </ol>

    <p> If the wine has a stranger tinge and a bad smell it could be your wine is corked. Make sure you swirl it before the sight and smell tests!</p>
